Derek Lilienthal

In this project, i created:

1. Number pad
2. Distance formula
3. Add, subtract, multiply and divide buttons
4. Modulus button
5. Negative button
6. Factorial button
7. Sine, Cosine, Tangent buttons
8. Space button
9. Exponent button
10. Square root button
11. Degrees to radians and radians to degrees buttons
12. Natural log button (e)
13. Absolute value button
14. Pie button
15. Answer button that takes the output and 
puts it back in the input
16. A delete button that erases the last character that is 
in the input field
17. The Rot function that moves 3 numbers
18. The swap button that swaps 2 numbers
19. Sounds that play with each button hit. 

I also created an if statement for all of the functions so
therortically, you shouldnt be able to add more than one space
into the input. Also, you should be able to fluently press
numbers then whatever function you want after it and the space
will add automatically before and after.
